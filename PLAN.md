## Task Breakdown
| Step | Description | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Capture requirements and lay out work items in PLAN.md | Done | Summarised scope from design doc and repository goals. |
| 2 | Scaffold Rust workspace and crate skeletons aligned with the design | Done | Workspace file plus per-crate Cargo manifests and placeholder modules. |
| 3 | Add repository documentation (README, design doc, AGENTS guidance) | Done | Authored README, captured the design doc verbatim, and wrote repo-wide agent instructions. |
| 4 | Run baseline tooling (`cargo fmt`, `cargo check`) | Done | Verified formatting and compilation of the newly scaffolded workspace. |

## Progress Log
- Initialised planning document to track tasks and their completion.
